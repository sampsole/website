		<p class="tagline">They're otterly adorable.</p>

		<section class="pageContent">
			<p>Otters have long, slim bodies and relatively 
				short limbs. Their most striking anatomical 
				features are the powerful webbed feet used 
				to swim, and their seal-like ability to hold 
				their breath underwater. Most have sharp 
				claws on their feet and all except the sea 
				otter have long, muscular tails. There are 
				  13 species of otter.</p>


			<h2>Diet</h2>

			<p>For most otters, fish is the staple of their 
			diet. This is often supplemented by frogs, 
			crayfish and crabs. Some otters are experts 
			at opening shellfish, and others will feed 
			  on available small mammals or birds.</p>

			<p>They are notable for their ability to use 
			stones to break open shellfish on their 
			stomachs. This skill must be learnt by 
			  the young.</p>


			<h2>Behaviour</h2>

			<p>Otters are playful animals and appear 
			to engage in various behaviors for sheer 
			enjoyment, such as making waterslides 
			and then sliding on them into the water. 
			They may also find and play with small 
			stones. Different species vary in their 
			social structure, with some being largely 
			solitary, while others live in groups â€“ 
			in a few species these groups may be 
			  fairly large.</p>
